# Acoustic Analysis Using BirdNET-Analyzer and Other Tools

Use of the BirdNET-Analyzer detector and other tools to analyze acoustic data. 


BirdNET-Analyzer is a python model/tool. There is a Windows GUI.  It can be run from command in Windows shell, in a python programming environment (e.g., VS Code), also within RStudio using the NSNSDAcoustics package. Can also be run from within Raven. In R, it still requires that Python be installed. 

Note that you should check for updates of the  windows GUI. Seems to be in active development. 

NSNSDAAcoustics has excellent help in the main repo and the R help files.
